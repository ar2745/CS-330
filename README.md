The course provided an opportunity to acquire new design skills, specifically in the utilization of OpenGL to construct an interactive 3D scene. During the design process, various shapes including cubes, pyramids, and spheres were employed to create a milk carton on a plane. The acquired skills are transferable and can be leveraged for future projects such as the creation of 3D images for clients or the design of video games. 

During the creation of this 3D scene, development strategies were implemented to ensure a smooth workflow. Primarily, tutorials and documentation were consulted to navigate the intricacies of the code. As the project progressed, iteration emerged as a key component in the process, given the need to verify each input in the arrays and ensure the desired output was achieved. The approach gradually became more streamlined, following a structured pattern of consulting documentation and videos, practicing, and then implementing the newly acquired knowledge into the creation of the 3D scene, resulting in the successful realization of the image.

The study of computational graphics confers valuable skills that can be applied to other courses, such as game development, where this knowledge may prove useful in completing future assignments. Furthermore, this expertise can be utilized in a professional capacity, especially in showcasing one's skills to potential employers or companies. By demonstrating proficiency in computational graphics, individuals seeking employment can provide tangible evidence of their capabilities and enhance their prospects of securing desired positions.
